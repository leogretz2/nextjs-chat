  question: "A state statute requires the permanent removal from parental custody of any child who has suffered 'child abuse.' That term is defined to include 'corporal punishment of any sort.' A father very gently spanks his six-year-old son on the buttocks whenever he believes that spanking is necessary to enforce discipline on him. Such a spanking occurs not more than once a month and has never physically harmed the child. The state files suit under the statute to terminate the father's parental rights solely because of these spankings. The father defends only on the ground that the statute in question is unconstitutional as applied to his admitted conduct. In light of the nature of the rights involved, which of the following is the most probable burden of persuasion on this constitutional use?",
  answers: {
    A: 'The state has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to the father is necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest.',
    B: 'The state has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to the father is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.',

  explanation: "The government is attempting to restrict a fundamental right, which is the right to raise one's children. When a fundamental right is involved, the strict scrutiny standard applies. Under strict scrutiny, the state must prove that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly tailored to address that interest. Thus, the correct answer is that the state has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to the father is necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

before (Line_0439): A state statute requires the permanent removal from parental custody of any child who has suffered "child abuse." That term is defined to include "corporal punishment of any sort." A father very gently spanks his six-year-old son on the buttocks whenever he believes that spanking is necessary to enforce discipline on him. Such a spanking occurs not more than once a month and has never physically harmed the child. The state files suit under the statute to terminate the father's parental rights solely because of these spankings. The father defends only on the ground that the statute in question is unconstitutional as applied to his admitted conduct. In light of the nature of the rights involved, which of the following is the most probable burden of persuasion on this constitutional use?
(Line_0440): A. The state has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to the father is necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest.
(Line_0441): B. The state has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to the father is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
(Line_0442): C. The father has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to him is not necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest.
(Line_0443): D. The father has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to him is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
(Line_0444):  
(Line_0445): According to a state statute, a candidate for state office may have his name placed on the official election ballot only if he files a petition with the appropriate state official containing a specified number of voter signatures. A politician failed to get his name placed on the state ballot as an independent candidate for governor because he failed to file a petition with the number of voter signatures required by state statute. In a suit against the appropriate state official in federal district court, the politician sought an injunction against signature requirement on the ground that it was unconstitutional.
(Line_0446): Which of the following, if established, constitutes the strongest argument for the politician?
(Line_0447): A. Compliance with the petition signature requirement is burdensome.
(Line_0448): B. The objectives of the statute could be satisfactorily achieved by less burdensome means.
(Line_0449): C. Because of the petition signature requirement, very few independent candidates have ever succeeded in getting on the ballot.
(Line_0450): D. The motivation for the statute was a desire to keep candidates off the ballot if they did not have strong support among voters.
(Line_0451):  
(Line_0452): Congress passes an Energy Conservation Act. The act requires all users of energy in this country to reduce their consumption by a specified percentage, to be set by a presidential executive order. The act sets forth specific standards the President must use in setting the percentage and detailed procedures to be followed.
(Line_0453): The provision that allows the President to set the exact percentage is probably
(Line_0454): A. constitutional, because it creates a limited administrative power to implement the statute.
(Line_0455): B. constitutional, because inherent executive powers permit such action even without statutory authorization.
(Line_0456): C. unconstitutional as an undue delegation of legislative power to the executive.
(Line_0457): D. unconstitutional, because it violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

The act sets forth specific standards the President must use in setting the percentage and detailed procedures to be followed.
(Line_0453): The provision that allows the President to set the exact percentage is probably
(Line_0454): A. constitutional, because it creates a limited administrative power to implement the statute.
(Line_0455): B. constitutional, because inherent executive powers permit such action even without statutory authorization.
(Line_0456): C. unconstitutional as an undue delegation of legislative power to the executive.
(Line_0457): D. unconstitutional, because it violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

  _explanation: "When challenging a law that imposes restrictions on ballot access, one of the strongest arguments is that the objectives of the statute could be achieved by less burdensome means. This is in line with the standard of intermediate scrutiny, where the law must be substantially related to an important government interest, but the burden imposed must not be greater than necessary. By showing that less burdensome means are available, the politician would have a strong argument that the statute is not appropriately tailored to achieve the state's objectives. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

  _question: 'According to a state statute, a candidate for state office may have his name placed on the official election ballot only if he files a petition with the appropriate state official containing a specified number of voter signatures. A politician failed to get his name placed on the state ballot as an independent candidate for governor because he failed to file a petition with the number of voter signatures required by state statute. In a suit against the appropriate state official in federal district court, the politician sought an injunction against signature requirement on the ground that it was unconstitutional. Which of the following, if established, constitutes the strongest argument for the politician?',

  _explanation: 'The provision allowing the President to set the exact percentage in energy reduction is likely unconstitutional as an undue delegation of legislative power to the executive. While Congress can delegate certain powers to the executive branch, it must provide an intelligible principle to guide the exercise of those powers. Here, although specific standards and detailed procedures are set, allowing the President to determine the exact percentage crosses the line into legislative territory, which only Congress can control. This is not a matter of inherent executive power, as the setting of percentages is distinctly legislative. Therefore, the best answer is C.',

Question: 
\`(Line_0863): The National Ecological Balance Act prohibits the destruction or removal of any wild animals located on lands owned by the United States without express permission from the Federal Bureau of Land Management. Violaters are subject to fines of up to $1,000 per offense.

(Line_0865): After substantial property damage was inflicted on residents of a particular state by hungry coyotes, the state legislature passed the Coyote Bounty Bill, which offers $25 for each coyote killed or captured within the state. A national forest, owned by the federal government, is located entirely within the state. Many coyotes live in this national forest.

(Line_0867): Without seeking permission from the Bureau of Land Management, a hunter shot several coyotes in the national forest and collected the bounty from the state. As a result, he was subsequently tried in federal district court, convicted, and fined $1,000 for violating the National Ecological Balance Act. A hunter appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals.

(Line_0870): A. constitutional, because the property clause of Article IV, Section 3, of the Constitution authorizes such federal statutory controls and sanctions.
(Line_0871): B. constitutional, because Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution authorizes Congress to enact all laws necessary and proper to advance the general welfare.
(Line_0872): C. unconstitutional, because Congress may not use its delegated powers to override the Tenth Amendment right of the state to legislate in areas of traditional state governmental functions, such as the protection of the property of its residents.
(Line_0873): D. unconstitutional, because Congress violates the full faith and credit clause of Article IV when it punishes conduct that has been authorized by state action.\`
---LATER---
Answer: A is the correct answer. The government may regulate the time, place, and manner of speech as long as that regulation: 1) is content neutral, 2) serves a substantial governmental interest, and 3) is narrowly tailored so that there are alternative avenues of expression open. This regulation is a time, place, and manner regulation because it affects only the volume of the expression. B, C, and D give the incorrect standards for this type of regulation.

(Line_0855): In response to massive layoffs of employees of automobile assembly plants located in a particular state, the legislature of that state enacted a statute which prohibits the parking of automobiles manufactured outside of the United States in any parking lot or parking structure that is owned or operated by the state or any of its instrumentalities. This statute does not apply to parking on public streets.

(Line_0857): Which of the following is the strongest argument with which to challenge the constitutionality of this statute?
(Line_0858): A. The statute imposes an undue burden on foreign commerce.
(Line_0859): B. The statute denies the owners of foreign-made automobiles the equal protection of the laws.
(Line_0860): C. The statute deprives the owners of foreign-made automobiles of liberty or property without due process of law.
(Line_0861): D. The statute is inconsistent with the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(Line_0874):  
(Line_0875): A law of a state imposed a generally applicable sales tax payable by the vendor. That law exempted from its provisions the sale of "all magazines, periodicals, newspapers, and books." In order to raise additional revenue, the state legislature eliminated that broad exemption and substituted a narrower exemption. The new, narrower exemption excluded from the state sales tax only the sale of those "magazines, periodicals, newspapers, and books that are published or distributed by a recognized religious faith and that consist wholly of writings sacred to such a religious faith."

(Line_0877): One magazine is a monthly publication devoted to history and politics. The magazine paid under protest the sales tax due on its sales according to the amended sales tax law. The magazine then filed suit against the state in an appropriate state court for a refund of the sales taxes paid. It contended that the state's elimination of the earlier, broader exemption and adoption of the new, narrower exemption restricted to sacred writings of recognized religious faiths violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. In this case, the court will probably rule that
(Line_0878): A. the magazine lacks standing to sue for a refund of sales taxes imposed by a generally applicable state law because Article III of the Constitution precludes taxpayers from bringing such suits.
(Line_0879): B. the Eleventh Amendment bars the state court from exercising jurisdiction over this suit in the absence of a law of the state expressly waiving the state's immunity.
(Line_0880): C. the new, narrower exemption from the state sales tax law violates the establishment clause of the First and Fourteenth Amendments by granting preferential state support to recognized religious faiths for the communication of their religious beliefs.
(Line_0881): D. the new, narrower exemption from the state sales tax law violates the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it imposes a prior restraint on nonreligious publications that are required to pay the tax.
(Line_0882):  
(Line_0883): A statute in a particular state provided state monetary grants to private dance, theater, and opera groups located in that state. The statute required recipients of such grants to use the granted monies for the acquisition, construction, and maintenance of appropriate facilities for the public performance of their performing arts. The last section of the statute conditioned the award of each such grant on the recipient's agreement to refrain from all kinds of political lobbying calculated to secure additional tax support for the performing arts. The strongest constitutional basis for an attack upon the validity of the last section of the statute would be based upon the
(Line_0884): A. commerce clause.
(Line_0885): B. obligation of contracts clause.
(Line_0886): C. Fifth Amendment.
(Line_0887): D. First and Fourteenth Amendments.
(Line_0888):  
(Line_0889):  X--Assume that Congress passed and the President signed the following statute:"The appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court shall not extend to any case involving the constitutionality of any state statute limiting the circumstances in which a woman may obtain an abortion, or involving the constitutionality of this statute." The strongest argument against the constitutionality of this statute is that

(Line_0891): A. Congress may not exercise its authority over the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in a way that seriously interferes with the establishment of a supreme and uniform body of federal constitutional law.
(Line_0892): B. Congress may only regulate the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over cases initially arising in federal courts.
(Line_0893): C. the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court may only be altered by a constitutional amendment.
(Line_0894): D. the statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(Line_0895):  
(Line_0896): The federal statute admitting a particular state to the Union granted the state certain public lands, and established some very ambiguous conditions on the subsequent disposition of these lands by the state. This federal statute also required the new state to write those exact same conditions into its state constitution. One hundred years later, a statute of the state dealing with the sale of these public lands was challenged in a state court lawsuit on the ground that it was inconsistent with the conditions contained in the federal statute, and with the provisions of the state constitution that exactly copy the conditions contained in the federal statute. The trial court decision in this case was appealed to the state supreme court. In its opinion, the state supreme court dealt at length with the ambiguous language of the federal statute and with cases interpreting identical language in federal statutes admitting other states to the union. The state supreme court opinion did not discuss the similar provisions of the state constitution, but it did hold that the challenged state statute is invalid because it is "inconsistent with the language of the federal statute and therefore is inconsistent with the identical provisions of our state constitution."
(Line_0897): If the losing party in the state supreme court seeks review of the decision of that court in the United States Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court should
(Line_0898): A. accept the case for review and determine the validity and interpretation of the federal statute if it is an important and substantial question.
(Line_0899): B. ask the state supreme court to indicate more clearly whether it relied on the state constitutional provision in rendering its decision.
(Line_0900): C. decline to review the case on the ground that the decision of the state supreme court rests on an adequate and independent state ground.
(Line_0901): D. decline to review the case because a decision by a state supreme court concerning the proper disposition of state public lands is not reviewable by the United States Supreme Court.
(Line_0902):  












(Line_0858): A. The statute imposes an undue burden on foreign commerce.
(Line_0859): B. The statute denies the owners of foreign-made automobiles the equal protection of the laws.

One hundred years later, a statute of the state dealing with the sale of these public lands was challenged in a state court lawsuit on the ground that it was inconsistent with the conditions contained in the federal statute, and with the provisions of the state constitution that exactly copy the conditions contained in the federal statute. The trial court decision in this case was appealed to the state supreme court. In its opinion, the state supreme court dealt at length with the ambiguous language of the federal statute and with cases interpreting identical language in federal statutes admitting other states to the union. The state supreme court opinion did not discuss the similar provisions of the state constitution, but it did hold that the challenged state statute is invalid because it is "inconsistent with the language of the federal statute and therefore is inconsistent with the identical provisions of our state constitution."
(Line_0897): If the losing party in the state supreme court seeks review of the decision of that court in the United States Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court should
(Line_0898): A. accept the case for review and determine the validity and interpretation of the federal statute if it is an important and substantial question.
(Line_0899): B. ask the state supreme court to indicate more clearly whether it relied on the state constitutional provision in rendering its decision.
(Line_0900): C. decline to review the case on the ground that the decision of the state supreme court rests on an adequate and independent state ground.
(Line_0901): D. decline to review the case because a decision by a state supreme court concerning the proper disposition of state public lands is not reviewable by the United States Supreme Court.
(Line_0902):  


(Line_0858): A. The statute imposes an undue burden on foreign commerce.
(Line_0859): B. The statute denies the owners of foreign-made automobiles the equal protection of the laws.
(Line_0860): C. The statute deprives the owners of foreign-made automobiles of liberty or property without due process of law.
(Line_0861): D. The statute is inconsistent with the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(Line_0862):  
(Line_0863): The National Ecological Balance Act prohibits the destruction or removal of any wild animals located on lands owned by the United States without express permission from the Federal Bureau of Land Management. Violaters are subject to fines of up to $1,000 per offense.

(Line_0865): After substantial property damage was inflicted on residents of a particular state by hungry coyotes, the state legislature passed the Coyote Bounty Bill, which offers $25 for each coyote killed or captured within the state. A national forest, owned by the federal government, is located entirely within the state. Many coyotes live in this national forest.

(Line_0867): Without seeking permission from the Bureau of Land Management, a hunter shot several coyotes in the national forest and collected the bounty from the state. As a result, he was subsequently tried in federal district court, convicted, and fined $1,000 for violating the National Ecological Balance Act. A hunter appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals.

(Line_0874):  
(Line_0875): A law of a state imposed a generally applicable sales tax payable by the vendor. That law exempted from its provisions the sale of "all magazines, periodicals, newspapers, and books." In order to raise additional revenue, the state legislature eliminated that broad exemption and substituted a narrower exemption. The new, narrower exemption excluded from the state sales tax only the sale of those "magazines, periodicals, newspapers, and books that are published or distributed by a recognized religious faith and that consist wholly of writings sacred to such a religious faith."

(Line_0877): One magazine is a monthly publication devoted to history and politics. The magazine paid under protest the sales tax due on its sales according to the amended sales tax law. The magazine then filed suit against the state in an appropriate state court for a refund of the sales taxes paid. It contended that the state's elimination of the earlier, broader exemption and adoption of the new, narrower exemption restricted to sacred writings of recognized religious faiths violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. In this case, the court will probably rule that
(Line_0878): A. the magazine lacks standing to sue for a refund of sales taxes imposed by a generally applicable state law because Article III of the Constitution precludes taxpayers from bringing such suits.
(Line_0879): B. the Eleventh Amendment bars the state court from exercising jurisdiction over this suit in the absence of a law of the state expressly waiving the state's immunity.
(Line_0880): C. the new, narrower exemption from the state sales tax law violates the establishment clause of the First and Fourteenth Amendments by granting preferential state support to recognized religious faiths for the communication of their religious beliefs.
(Line_0881): D. the new, narrower exemption from the state sales tax law violates the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it imposes a prior restraint on nonreligious publications that are required to pay the tax.
(Line_0882):  
(Line_0883): A statute in a particular state provided state monetary grants to private dance, theater, and opera groups located in that state. The statute required recipients of such grants to use the granted monies for the acquisition, construction, and maintenance of appropriate facilities for the public performance of their performing arts. The last section of the statute conditioned the award of each such grant on the recipient's agreement to refrain from all kinds of political lobbying calculated to secure additional tax support for the performing arts. The strongest constitutional basis for an attack upon the validity of the last section of the statute would be based upon the
(Line_0884): A. commerce clause.
(Line_0885): B. obligation of contracts clause.
(Line_0886): C. Fifth Amendment.
(Line_0887): D. First and Fourteenth Amendments.
(Line_0888):  
(Line_0889):  X--Assume that Congress passed and the President signed the following statute:"The appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court shall not extend to any case involving the constitutionality of any state statute limiting the circumstances in which a woman may obtain an abortion, or involving the constitutionality of this statute." The strongest argument against the constitutionality of this statute is that

(Line_0891): A. Congress may not exercise its authority over the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in a way that seriously interferes with the establishment of a supreme and uniform body of federal constitutional law.
(Line_0892): B. Congress may only regulate the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over cases initially arising in federal courts.
(Line_0893): C. the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court may only be altered by a constitutional amendment.
(Line_0894): D. the statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(Line_0895):  
(Line_0896): The federal statute admitting a particular state to the Union granted the state certain public lands, and established some very ambiguous conditions on the subsequent disposition of these lands by the state. This federal statute also required the new state to write those exact same conditions into its state constitution. One hundred years later, a statute of the state dealing with the sale of these public lands was challenged in a state court lawsuit on the ground that it was inconsistent with the conditions contained in the federal statute, and with the provisions of the state constitution that exactly copy the conditions contained in the federal statute.

  // Construct the prompt using template literals
  const promptContent = `You are a coveted AI legal expert who is a bar exam master and gets a perfect score on every exam question. You have been designed to assist in the organization and management of bar exam study materials. Your current task is to format, validate, and load various types of legal questions into a structured database.
  
  You have access to four tools. Three are for adding questions to the database: insert_mbe_question, insert_mee_question, and insert_mpt_question. Ensure that you record the lines that you copy from and send them as a parameter to the function via Doc_Lines_to_Delete so that you do not repeat content. The last tool, end_document_processing, is for ending processing of a document once all questions are gone. Ensure that you follow the operational guidelines exactly.
  
  Operational Guidelines:
  
  1. Record your data exactly as it appears in the source document.
  2. Record and list EACH AND EVERY line number of the lines [lines noted in the format: '(Line_####):'] that you copied your content from on the source document to send as Doc_Lines_to_Delete so that you do not repeat content.
  3. Format your response perfectly to fit the structure of the functions that you want to call.
  4. Respond only in JSON and ensure that it is well formatted and valid. No other prose.
  5. Ensure you only make a single tool call for each question. You can do multiple questions in one response via multiple tool calls if it doesn't decrease quality.
  6. Question type can be 'MBE', 'MEE', or 'MPT'. All multiple choice questions are type MBE. Only do MBE questions for now!
  7. If there is no clear data on the document date or publisher, insert the value 'NA'.
  8. If there is an answer for the question in the document ensure that you use it! If there is no answer in the document, ensure that the one you create is perfect and accurate.
  9. Answer origin can be 'Generated' or 'Document'.
  10. If there is an explanation for the answer in the document ensure that you use it! If there is no explanation in the document, ensure that the one you create is clear, concise, and accurate. Don't just state why the correct answer is correct. Go through the thought process, canceling out the other options logically with reasoning why, and conclude your explanation by revealing the correct answer only after the full thought process is complete. If there is an explanation in the document already but does not fit your ideal structure of including the logical thought process, then use it as context to craft your own.
  11. Explanation origin can be 'Generated' or 'Document'.
  12. Difficulty score is out of 100 and is in the context of the average bar exam question being a 50.
  13: When there are no more questions in the document, call the end_document_processing tool with the boolean true. If there are more questions in the document that you were not able to get this time DO NOT call end_document_processing so that you get sent the document again for another round of processing.

Questions:
Additional preprocessing to remove non-question text from documents? Heuristics involving characters/whitespace only remaining will be a lot more effective.
Give it memory/lines processed variable.
Additional preprocessing to mark out five question chunks
Convert question to primary key, fast (O(1)?) supabase check before write


523:
Solved duplicate/outdated documentContent - untangled looping
incorporate exponential backoff

524:
This prompt worked really well: 
  Given this document, your task is to extract any ONE question and its matching explanation at some point later in the document. Print out the question (which will likely span multiple paragraphs), the explanation, and a list of line numbers each in the format '(Line_####):' on which the question and explanation were found.


525:
a federal statute provides that the United States Supreme Court has authority; generated answer: Under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in very limited cases, such as those involving ambassadors or where a state is a party. In all other cases, the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction, which means it can review decisions of lower federal and state courts. Here, the petitioners are asking the Supreme Court to review a case that has not yet been decided by any lower court, which does not fall within the Court's original jurisdiction. Therefore, there is no lower court judgment for the Supreme Court to review, making it outside the scope of its appellate jurisdiction as well. As such, the best constitutional argument in support of the EPA's request to dismiss the petition is that the case is not within the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction and is not a proper subject for its appellate jurisdiction because it has not been decided by any lower court.
